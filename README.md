YelpCamp is a website where people can share and review campgrounds. To write reviews or add new camping spots, you need to have an account. It's a project from Colt Steele's web dev bootcamp on Udemy.

The site is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. Passport.js is used to handle user logins securely.
